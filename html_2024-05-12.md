## HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's like the skeleton of a website, giving structure and content. Think of HTML as a recipe for making a cake. The recipe tells you what ingredients you need (like text, images, and links) and how to arrange them to make something delicious, or in this case, a webpage.

Components of HTML

Elements: These are the basic building blocks of HTML. Elements are made up of tags, which are like labels you put on different parts of your content to tell the web browser how to display them. For example, <p> is a tag used for paragraphs.

Tags: Tags come in pairs, most of the time. You have an opening tag like <p> and a closing tag like </p>. Everything in between these tags is affected by them. For a real-life analogy, imagine tags as bread slices in a sandwich; whatever you put between the bread becomes part of the sandwich.

Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about elements. They come in the form of name-value pairs and are placed inside the opening tag. For instance, if you want to color your paragraph text blue, you might use the style attribute like this: <p style="color: blue;">.

Nesting: Nesting is putting one element inside another. This is like putting a small box inside a bigger box. For example, if you want to emphasize a word inside a paragraph, you would nest the <strong> tag inside the <p> tag like so:

```html
<p>This is a very <strong>important</strong> point.</p>
```
Example of a Simple HTML Page

Let’s make a simple webpage recipe. We’ll include a heading, a paragraph, and an image.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Simple Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my webpage. Isn’t it exciting?</p>
    <img src="smileyface.jpg" alt="A Smiling Face">
</body>
</html>
```

Here's what each part does:

<!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
<html> starts the HTML document.
<head> is like the preparation section of our recipe, where we put settings and instructions that don’t appear directly on the page, like the title.
<title> is like naming your recipe. It shows up as the name on the browser tab.
<body> is where all the content that shows up on the main part of the webpage goes.
<h1> is a heading tag, making text big and bold, like a chapter title in a book.
<p> is for paragraphs, just like writing a normal paragraph in English class.
<img> is an image tag, where src (source) tells the browser where the image is located, and alt (alternative text) describes the image if it can’t be displayed.
