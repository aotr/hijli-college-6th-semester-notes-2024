## HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's like the skeleton of a website, giving structure and content. Think of HTML as a recipe for making a cake. The recipe tells you what ingredients you need (like text, images, and links) and how to arrange them to make something delicious, or in this case, a webpage.

Components of HTML

Elements: These are the basic building blocks of HTML. Elements are made up of tags, which are like labels you put on different parts of your content to tell the web browser how to display them. For example, <p> is a tag used for paragraphs.

Tags: Tags come in pairs, most of the time. You have an opening tag like <p> and a closing tag like </p>. Everything in between these tags is affected by them. For a real-life analogy, imagine tags as bread slices in a sandwich; whatever you put between the bread becomes part of the sandwich.

Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about elements. They come in the form of name-value pairs and are placed inside the opening tag. For instance, if you want to color your paragraph text blue, you might use the style attribute like this: <p style="color: blue;">.

Nesting: Nesting is putting one element inside another. This is like putting a small box inside a bigger box. For example, if you want to emphasize a word inside a paragraph, you would nest the <strong> tag inside the <p> tag like so:

```html
<p>This is a very <strong>important</strong> point.</p>
```
Example of a Simple HTML Page

Let’s make a simple webpage recipe. We’ll include a heading, a paragraph, and an image.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Simple Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my webpage. Isn’t it exciting?</p>
    <img src="smileyface.jpg" alt="A Smiling Face">
</body>
</html>
```

Here's what each part does:

<!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
<html> starts the HTML document.
<head> is like the preparation section of our recipe, where we put settings and instructions that don’t appear directly on the page, like the title.
<title> is like naming your recipe. It shows up as the name on the browser tab.
<body> is where all the content that shows up on the main part of the webpage goes.
<h1> is a heading tag, making text big and bold, like a chapter title in a book.
<p> is for paragraphs, just like writing a normal paragraph in English class.
<img> is an image tag, where src (source) tells the browser where the image is located, and alt (alternative text) describes the image if it can’t be displayed.

## HTML Attributes:

### Understanding HTML Attributes

HTML attributes are special words used within HTML tags to control the tag's behavior or to provide additional information about an element. They are like the settings on your smartphone apps or gadgets, letting you customize how they work or what they display.

### Basic Concept of Attributes

Attributes are always specified in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs like this: `name="value"`. For example, if you think of the `<img>` tag as a command to display a picture, the attributes tell the browser where to find the picture and what alternative text to display if the picture can't be loaded.

### Common Attributes

Here are some of the most commonly used HTML attributes:

1. **id**: Gives a unique identity to an element. It's like a personal name for that part of the webpage, which can be used by CSS and JavaScript to style or manipulate that specific element.
   ```html
   <div id="header">This is the header of the page.</div>
   ```

2. **class**: Assigns a class to an element. Unlike `id`, you can use the same class on multiple elements. This is useful for styling groups of elements in the same way or for applying JavaScript actions to them.
   ```html
   <div class="note">This is a note.</div>
   ```

3. **style**: Allows you to apply CSS styles directly to the element. This is like changing the outfit of the element to make it look a certain way.
   ```html
   <p style="color: blue;">This text is blue.</p>
   ```

4. **title**: Provides extra information about an element. It is usually displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the element.
   ```html
   <p title="Hello Tooltip!">Hover over me to see a tooltip.</p>
   ```

5. **href**: Used in anchor tags (`<a>`), it indicates the URL to which the link points.
   ```html
   <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
   ```

6. **src**: Used in image (`<img>`) and script (`<script>`) tags, it specifies the URL of the image or script.
   ```html
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
   ```

7. **alt**: Used with `<img>` tags, it provides alternative text which describes the image if it can't be displayed.
   ```html
   <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
   ```

8. **type**: Often seen in `<input>` and `<script>` tags, it specifies the type of input or script.
   ```html
   <input type="text" name="firstname">
   <script type="text/javascript">
   ```

### Advanced Attributes

There are attributes designed for specific elements to handle particular tasks:

- **`placeholder`** in `<input>` elements: Shows a hint to the user about what kind of information is expected before they start typing.
- **`disabled`** and **`readonly`** in form elements: Control whether the user can change the value of an input.
- **`selected`**, **`checked`**, and **`required`** in form elements: These influence how options in forms are initially displayed (whether they are selected by default, whether a checkbox is checked, or whether a field must be filled out).

### Practical Example

Let's put together a simple form to see attributes in action:

```html
<form action="/submit-form" method="POST">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name" required placeholder="Enter your name">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In this example:
- The `<form>` tag uses `action` to specify where to send the form data when submitted and `method` to specify how to send it.
- The `<input>` tags use `type`, `id`, `name`, `required`, and `placeholder` to define what kind of input they accept and how they should behave.
